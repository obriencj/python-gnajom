gnajom auth

# looks in the ~/.gnajom/settings.conf for the profile, loads
# those settings (username, server) and authenticates. If password is
# undefined, prompt for it. This will write out a session file.

gnajom auth --user someone@gmail.com --session ~/.gnajom/someone.session

# uses a specific username and session file, ignoring those settings
# from ~/.gnajom/settings.conf

gnajom auth --refresh

# attempts to auth as above, but first checks for session file and tries
# to refresh. if that fails, then does a full auth

gnajom refresh

# looks in ~/.gnajom/settings.conf for the first profile, loads
# those settings, looks for session file. if present, submits the
# validate action. if validate fails then run refresh, otherwise keep
# existing session

gnajom refresh --force

# like above, but doesn't validate -- always runs the refresh

gnajom verify

# just checks if the existing session file is still verified.

# looks at the realms the default user (which must be authenticated
# and valid) has access to.
